# Zombie-Chase-CE
Originally developed for the Casio PRIZM line of calculators, Zombie Chase is a game in which you are a white dot attempting to survive the zombie apocalypse. You must collect red health packs and avoid green zombies, or you will become infected and die. Once you've been bitten, your health decreases gradually over time making it more difficult to collect as many points.
